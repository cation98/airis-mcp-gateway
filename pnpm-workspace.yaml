# airis resolves versions from manifest.toml [packages.catalog] and writes
# them directly to package.json. This is a superior approach because:
# - Works with any package manager (pnpm/npm/yarn/bun)
# - Supports "latest", "lts", "follow" policies via airis
# - No dependency on pnpm's catalog feature
#
# Use manifest.toml [packages.catalog] for version management:
#   [packages.catalog]
#   next = "latest"      # airis resolves to ^16.0.3
#   react = "lts"        # airis resolves to ^18.3.1
#
# Then reference in dependencies:
#   [packages.root.devDependencies]
#   next = "catalog:"    # → ^16.0.3 in package.json
